## Binary Search Tree implementation.

# We will have Node class which has root, a leftNode and a rightNode

## A Tree Interface contains methods of implementation as insertion, deletion, getMaxValue, getMinValue etc

# BnarySearchTree class which implements Tree Interface and will define all the methods

# App Class will have main() method and will execute all the methods with proper output

## Most typical implementation is deleteNode... look carefully
